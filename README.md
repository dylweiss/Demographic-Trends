Our project uses a web scraping algorithm to retrieve some information on all 50 states in the US.
Based on the information retrieved, we came up with 3 different hypotheses and did some testing
on each to draw our conclusions. We also used graph visualizations to present our data more clearly.
Finally, we implemented BFS based on border information on each state to find the shortest path
between states.
