summary.txt:
This file contains an overall description of the project, the categories used and the work breakdown.

DataScraper:
The DataScraper file contains all the code for scraping as well as finding the shortest path for
our graph algorithm.

Main:
The Main file uses the state information from DataScraper to complete a correlation analysis for
hypothesis 1.

stateBorderMain:
This file contains a main method that makes it easier for the user to test our shortest path algo.
The shortest path for the graph algorithm does not factor in state sizes but just find the fewest
number of states one would need to pass through to go from one state to another.

States data:
This file contains the state information returned by our scraper

NETS 1500 Project (pdf):
This file contains a summary of our three hypothesis, our methods and conclusions.

python.zip:
This zip file contains some extra code and data used for hypotheses 2 and 3
