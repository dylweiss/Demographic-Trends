Our project uses a web scraping algorithm to retrieve some information on all 50 states in the US.
Based on the information retrieved, we came up with 3 different hypotheses and did some testing
on each to draw our conclusions. We also used graph visualizations to present our data more clearly.
Finally, we implemented BFS based on border information on each state to find the shortest path
between states.

This project was part empirical analysis and part implementation containing information retrieval
and graph algorithms.
We all worked on the project together and had many calls to work together and bounce ideas
off each other. Kofi was mainly responsible for the web scraping and graph algorithm, Zachary is
responsible for visualizations and some hypothesis testing, while Dylan worked more on the
hypotheses development testing and conclusions.
However, we eventually executed all tasks as a team.
